/// GitHub stacked-PR builder for those who miss Gerrit
///
/// Main features:
///
/// * Never touches your local refs, index, worktree, or existing commits. The tool reads the local
///   branch, writes synthetic commits without attaching refs, fast-forwards namespaced remote refs,
///   and creates PRs and comments with the official GitHub UI.
/// * Treats one branch as one patch-stack, where each commit maps 1:1 to a PR.
/// * Uses the same "Change-Id" trailer used by Gerrit. You can install the commit-msg hook from
///   a Gerrit instance or use the install-hook subcommand to install an embedded copy.
/// * Generates "interdiff"-esque diffs for updates to changes and posts them as a comment on your
///   behalf when you push.
/// * Quiet by default. No news is good news, but you can also get verbose output or a dry-run.
/// * Uses the official `gh` tool to interface with the GitHub API, so you don't have
///   to go through authenticating another app.
/// * Uses the actual `git` command for network operations, so however you authenticate
///   works fine. (If you have to answer a prompt for each operation, you may have a
///   less than stellar experience, but it should work. Use the `--serial` option if you
///   want to do this).
/// * Painfully slow, but at least tries to claw back performance where possible, primarily by
///   parallelizing steps across all patches in the branch. There is a lot of room to
///   optimize still, it does the least clever thing imaginable in a lot of cases.
///
/// And currently its greatest shortcomings are:
///
/// * Currently lacks a lot of polish and documentation.
///
/// It reads configuration from the first of the following:
///
/// * The file identified by the environment variable `PRADDLE_CONFIG_PATH`, if that variable is set.
/// * The file `.praddle.toml` in the git repo's workdir, if it exists.
/// * The file `praddle.toml` in the git repo's workdir, if it exists.
/// * The file `praddle.toml` in platform-dependant user config dir, otherwise.
///
/// An example config file is:
///
///     remote = "origin"
///     base_branch = "main"
///     user_branch_prefix = "users/$USER/"
///

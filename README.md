GitHub stacked-PR builder for those who miss Gerrit

See `--help` for details.

# Etymology

<sub>(*Note:* This project was previously named `gd` and then `cgh`)</sub>

The name doesn't meaning anything, but it sounds like "prattle", which I enjoy.

A backronym might be "Pull Request, Add (Little Endian)".

# LLM use

It is unfortunate that this tool needs to exist at all, and even more
unfortunate that I don't have the time to dedicate to doing it right.

All development up to commit 0948335884fcb2645ada3985ff4c05dcf075b4f2 (v0.10.0)
was done by hand without LLMs, but at the point when GitHub rolled out their
(rather poor) support for stacks as a reified concept, I started using LLMs to
deal with what I perceive as design defects in their model.

# Testing

The `praddle-test-server` workspace crate provides a minimal, stateful GitHub
implementation for integration tests. It serves the GraphQL and REST operations
used by Praddle over a Unix socket and a single bare repository using Git smart
HTTP. This lets tests invoke the real `gh`, `git`, and `praddle` executables
without accessing GitHub or changing the user's configuration.

Run the suite with `cargo test --workspace`. See `test-server/README.md` for
standalone server usage.

# Alternatives

## `spr`

Somewhat confusingly there are at least two tools which nominally do the same
thing and are called `spr`. I'm unsure which came first, and it doesn't really
matter, but it is unfortunate they collide.

### `ejoffe/spr`

A very compelling alternative to `praddle` is https://github.com/ejoffe/spr which
differs in a few ways:

* `spr` will modify your local branches by default for logically
  non-destructive operations (i.e. when you try to `update` the remote)
* `spr` won't use Gerrit `Change-Id:`, and is very particular about the format
  of its ID; `praddle` allows any string and uses the `Change-Id:` trailer
* `spr` does not seem to have a `dry-run` option, which makes using it
  generally more nerve-wracking than necessary
* `spr` doesn't produce an "interdiff" when force-pushing to give the reviewer
  context for the edits to the change
* `spr` installs itself as a git subcommand (this is really just an aesthetic
  quibble, but I don't think it is primarily a `git` tool, it is a GitHub tool,
  and exists only to patch a deficiency in GitHub as a service)
* `spr` warns you to only close/merge PRs through it, rather than just
  diagnosing when e.g. a PR would be created for a change which already has a
  merged PR
* `spr` uses YAML for configuration, `praddle` uses TOML
* `spr` is noisy by default, `praddle` is quiet by default
* `spr` seems slightly less aggressive with parallelizing operations
* `spr` is written in Go, `praddle` is written in Rust

In the end most of these are fairly aesthetic and minor, but rather than try to
hack on `spr` I opted to start over and make the exact tool I wanted. YMMV

### `spacedentist/spr`

Another great contender, https://github.com/spacedentist/spr uses multiple
branches per PR to allow the local branch to be maintained as a set of changes
that is amended and rebased, while only fast-forwarding remote refs associated
with PRs so the GitHub UI doesn't throw away the context of comments and
collapse timeline entries.

The biggest issue (now) with this approach is that GitHub chose to codify the
force-push as a requirement in their model of stacks. So now, you can either
choose to contort your remote refs to avoid GitHub throwing away a bunch of
valuable information when you force-push, or you can have the new shiny
stack UI and merge queue. You can't have both!

There are other quibbles I have with this `spr`, but I think this is now the
overriding reason that I will not adopt this model.

## `gherrit`

A tool with a very similar core philosophy, https://github.com/joshlf/gherrit
seems to differ primarily in the UX and the structure of remote branches:

* Goes to greater lengths to reproduce the `git push`-based workflow of Gerrit
  proper. This involves intercepting the `push` through hooks.
* Retains more "phantom branches" on the remote to facilitate diffs and retain
  comments (if I understand it correctly).
* Also includes GH actions to keep the stack tidy and ready to merge. I don't
  fully understand how this works yet.

## `maiao`

I haven't actually used https://github.com/adevinta/maiao but came across it
since writing `praddle`. The biggest issue I see immediately is that it modifies
local refs to do fixups and rebases.

## `graphite`

I have had only negative experiences with https://graphite.dev/

In particular my issues are:

* Modifies local refs, and inserts itself into your workflow before you even
  consider creating PRs
* Requires a third-party service
* Is terribly slow (on top of the already slow GH API)
* Is closed-source
